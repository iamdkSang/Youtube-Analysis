UCZFkyg599M0UdYy4fIY_r1w,ART Classical Music ,"Welcome to ART Classical Music 

We love classical music as well as relaxing instrumental music so some years ago we decided to create this channel where you can find the best videos of well-known pieces of classical piano, violin and orchestral music combined with nature sounds and visuals in a unique way. We made original and educative videos from musical compositions performed by our musician partners which we transform to make them more suitable and attractive to the average viewer. This results in videos that are perfectly suitable to focus on studying, reading, working and improving your concentration and memorization while listening to the greatest composers of all times such as Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Chopin and many more. 

We hope you enjoy them!

Welcome to the HowToBBQRight Podcast with Malcom & Rachelle Reed. Here we talk all about our weekly YouTube recipes, what we’re grilling at the house, tips and tricks for grilling and our competition BBQ contests.

We started HowToBBQRight in 2007. We didn’t know what we were doing… but Malcom loved to cook BBQ and I knew just enough about designing a website to build one. Now we sell our own line of Killer Hogs BBQ Products and create weekly recipes for our HowToBBQRight YouTube Channel and website – and now we’re doing a Podcast! To us, it’s all about cooking delicious food and taking pride in everything we cook.

UCytudPHtHx5egRNLTGv5Pjw,Road Podcast,"Welcome to the R.O.A.D. Podcast.  The show gives you unfiltered opinions from the eyes and ears of 3 seasoned DJs from the Las Vegas nightclub industry. DJ Crooked and DJ Neva come to us by way of New York; Manhattan and The Bronx respectively. Both relocated to Vegas in the early 2000s to open, what was then, Light and Jet Nightclub.   Crooked is known for his workhorse mentality, and high-energy DJ sets, but has never been one for the industry politics.  While DJ Neva has earned his OG status due to his countless years of experience in the DJ game. In 2007, they brought a piece of home with them by founding KNYEW (an acronym for “Keeping New York Every Where), a successful clothing brand, the first of its kind to be seen in Las Vegas. Similarly, Jaime Da Great grew up in LA. Jaime, while making a huge name for himself in the sneaker industry, has shifted his focus to becoming a full-time DJ.
