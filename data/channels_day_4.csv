College Music is about new music from unheard artists and providing a platform for them to be heard by listeners like us.

Each upload has undergone a tedious process to ensure only the best quality. Besides providing a platform where you can find new songs and connect with other believers it has become my passion to create outstanding visual material with the recent focus on capturing the beauty of the Holy Land.
I hope you get blessed through music meets heaven & enjoy your stay""

In Feb 2015 we moved to Bahrain & due to several factors as well as attempting to get more involved in the online knitting community I decided to start a Podcast! Since then I started designing knitwear items, we have relocated (again) to New York City, & are expecting our first child in Feb 2017.

It has been quite the whirlwind ride since I made the fateful decision to start a podcast and I couldn't be happier with where I am now on my knitting/podcasting journey. 

Please get in touch by either leaving me a comment or contacting me via any of the other social media sites I'm on ... would love to hear from you ... and if you have any questions or ideas for the podcast those would also be welcome ...

Both relocated to Vegas in the early 2000s to open, what was then, Light and Jet Nightclub.   Crooked is known for his workhorse mentality, and high-energy DJ sets, but has never been one for the industry politics.  While DJ Neva has earned his OG status due to his countless years of experience in the DJ game. In 2007, they brought a piece of home with them by founding KNYEW (an acronym for “Keeping New York Every Where), a successful clothing brand, the first of its kind to be seen in Las Vegas. Similarly, Jaime Da Great grew up in LA. Jaime, while making a huge name for himself in the sneaker industry, has shifted his focus to becoming a full-time DJ.

Welcome to the HowToBBQRight Podcast with Malcom & Rachelle Reed. Here we talk all about our weekly YouTube recipes, what we’re grilling at the house, tips and tricks for grilling and our competition BBQ contests.

We started HowToBBQRight in 2007. We didn’t know what we were doing… but Malcom loved to cook BBQ and I knew just enough about designing a website to build one. Now we sell our own line of Killer Hogs BBQ Products and create weekly recipes for our HowToBBQRight YouTube Channel and website – and now we’re doing a Podcast! To us, it’s all about cooking delicious food and taking pride in everything we cook.

As you listen you will find yourself distracted from your worries and drifting off into dreamland..due to the fact the story gets a little bit more boring with each passing minute.

This podcast is a little weird, a bit silly and a tad offensive so beware. It is very similar to ASMR or guided meditation or hypnosis bedtime story that slowly carries you off to slumber.

""Sleep With Me"" is a groundbreaking podcast created to help you fall asleep. So get in bed, press play and drift off into dreamland. If you struggle with insomnia or just getting a good night's rest, you've found the podcast for you.

They can’t figure out a technique or don’t think that they could ever paint “like that,” and it creates a sense of unworthiness and fear. We are here to talk hobby, have some fun, and try and share our journeys in the hope that it will help you continue yours!
